Dr. Moebius Vs The World


*** Story ***
"Hello, I am Dr. Moebius! And this is my pyramid. It is like a torture chamber for heroes. And by heroes I mean you! Oh, BTW: I am evil!"

So, this Moebius guy is quite evil, right? And you have to save the world. Because... uhm, he's evil. Oh, and you will die... a lot. 


*** Instructions ***
Get to the end of each level preferably in one go!

There are lots of different traps (saw blades, falling stones, spikes, crushers): try to avoid them!
There are also mummies, because ...like... every pyramid has to have mummies! They try to kill you. Don't let them do that!

Although you have unlimited lives, there is a time limit on each level.
Each time you die or the time runs out, the level is resetted.
To increase the time available, you need to collect blue time orbs scattered across the level. Be careful though: Time is independant from dying.
Your current time amount is displayed as bar in the top left corner.

And by the way: you can use the corpses of your previous efforts to your advantage to block traps. It is not as weird as it sounds!


*** Controls ***
Use the "left" and "right" arrow keys to move your character around and the "up" key to jump.
Press the "R" key to reset your time and respawn at the beginning of the level.
The "F1" key shows you the intro and help screens again.

If you are really stuck, you can press the "Control" and "Enter" key at the same time to skip a level. Use at your own risk!
